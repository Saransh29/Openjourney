# OpenJourney

• Developed a web app to Generate an imaginative image through Stable Diffusion AI - midjourney v4 Model hosted on a GCP VM instance.<br>
• GCP VM instance connected to REST API via SSH tunnels.<br>
• REST API hosted on cyclic serverless functions.<br>
• Images and prompts data stored on MongoDB.<br>

Images stored in base64 format on MongoDB serverless database. (May take some time to fetch).

Ran out of GCP Credits , so switching to DALLE by OPENAI.

## Update - 1 

As on 28/03/2023 this project has garnered significant traction with 180 unique visitors from 36 countries accessing it over 500 times within just 15 days. 
I am proud to have facilitated over 400 images generated by users with custom prompts. I quickly bundled it up with MongoDB to store images in base64 format for community showcase.
